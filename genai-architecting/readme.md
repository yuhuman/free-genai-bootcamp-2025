## Functional requirements
The company decided to explore the implementation of AI systems. They did not allocate a significant amount of money before seeing something functional. Considering that the company has some expats who need to communicate at a basic level in Romanian with only Romanian-speaking employees, the tools should help them exercise their Romanian language and should be a companion tool to Romanian teachers.
## Assumptions
The initial budget should be kept at the minimum level
 - It is necessary we will reuse some computers that will not be used anymore in the company
 - Open-source LLM will be taken into consideration. For development and tests will be available some paid subscription
 - System(s) will be located in the main office and serve around 30 people.

## Considerations
All materials should be carefully reviewed before chosing the data model in order to avoid copyrights issues.
